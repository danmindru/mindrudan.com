      I'm web developer and designer, located in Copenhagen.
      Since as long as I can remember, I've been helping people start projects and get their ideas on the road.
      That includes working in the telco, architecture, medical, digital signage, real-estate, hydrology (and more) industries.



      Besides that, I quite fancy running and find hardware of any kind interesting.
      Drones are also something I dabble with, even though I'm not too good at flying them.
