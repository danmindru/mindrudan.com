<ContentPieceWrapper>

Shipixen allows you to create customized boilerplates for your product, blog or any other website. We generate it & even deploy it - then you get the code.

[I got this idea](https://twitter.com/d4m1n/status/1714527025996935601) when I realized how much time I am spending on repetitive tasks whenever I create a project.

## Difference compared to other boilerplates

Compared to other boilerplates, you can actually configure and deploy your landing page / blog / website without even touching the code.

It creates the relevant images, meta tags, pages, etc. for you so you can jump straight into action:

‚öôÔ∏è pre-configures your code <br/>
‚ú® makes logo, favicon, og data, pages w/ your brand<br/>
‚ñ≤ allows 1-click deploy<br/>

No manual work / CLI needed to deploy.

## Overview of the generated boilerplate

Depending on the configuration you choose, Shipixen will generate a website with all the bells and whistles you need to get started with your blog & landing page.

The blog comes with:

- tags / filters
- authors
- pagination
- syntax highlighting (ssr)
- citations and much more!

By default, shipixen will generate:

- logo, og image, favicon based on the images you provide
- SEO setup with best practices
- themed UI lib (shadcn)
- blog, search
- sitemap
- rss
- dark mode support
- privacy & terms pages (starters)
- pricing page

Technology-wise, you get:

- A Next.js app
- App router
- Typescript
- Tailwindcss
- mdx with contentlayer

At the end of the configuration process, you will get the option to either deploy with a click to Vercel or download a zip.

Either way, you get the source code and can do whatever you wish with it.

There is no database or 3rd party tool needed to run the website. It's a static website.

## Wrap-up

I'm super excited about this project and have already [used it to create shipixen.com](https://shipixen.com) and a couple other projects.

It has saved me 10s if not 100s of hours and I can't wait to get this in the hands of more people.
