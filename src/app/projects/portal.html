      <h3 class="normal-title second-title">Introduction</h3>
      <section class="default-paragraph with-images">
        <p class="default-paragraph">Portal is a tool targeted at the telecommunication industry for management of subscriptions, data packages and users within a firm (B2B). First developed for iPinion ApS, it was purchased by IPVision A/S in November 2013. The tool offers overview of consumption and offers administration tools not only for client firms, but also for customer service representatives. My task was to build the front-end and deliver a complete system together with a dedicated team of back-end developers.</p>

      <h3 class="normal-title second-title">The process</h3>
      <section class="default-paragraph with-images">
        <p class="default-paragraph">
        The development process started with the creation of basic use case diagrams, that offered an overview of the system architecture for both front and back-end. Afterwards, it continued with corporate and competitors analysis which resulted in the first interface drafts. Wireframes were created next, followed by a design style that included interface elements from color schemes to icons or buttons. Finally, the first prototype front-end was created and approved. From then on it was merged with the back-end to continue the development process in a unitary manner. The extensibility and flexibility was tested heavily with many additions and changes being applied in the following months. However, the nature of the telco industry makes the application subject to constant change.

      <h3 class="normal-title second-title">The dashboard</h3>
      <section class="default-paragraph with-images">
        <p class="default-paragraph">
        The homepage of the application (dashboard) offers overview of consumption for (by default) the current month of the entire company account. From the dashboard, certain periods can be selected as well as each user belonging to that company. The initial design envisioned a pie chart as the overview tool but in time it has been replaced with first a rectangle dashboard and finally by a horizontal one.

        For company accounts, all iterations include a fast-switch option for users as well as an option to pick a custom date interval on the top left of the header. When pressed or touched, a list of users within the company is displayed so each can be chosen in order to view the consumption for the selected period. The application changes with each user, giving administrators control over all the accounts.

      <section class="default-paragraph with-images">
        <p class="default-paragraph">
        Bellow the dashboard, controls for the current selected users are shown. From here, subscription can be modified and data packages can be added. The first iteration of the 'subscription change' was done by using a vertical layout and later changed to a horizontal one.

      <h3 class="normal-title second-title">Detailed consumption view</h3>
      <section class="default-paragraph with-images">
        <p class="default-paragraph">
        Besides the accounts administration, the user consumption is a very important component of the system. It offers detailed information about call, SMS, MMS and data usage. Each of the types are presented in three forms: line chart, bar chart and detailed view.
        </p>

        <p class="default-paragraph">
        Example of a call line-chart:

        </section>

        <p class="default-paragraph">
        The detailed view offers three types of sorting: by the number which the call was made, by the number which received the call and by date. This feature comes in handy considering that users often have multiple numbers and extensions.

      <h3 class="normal-title second-title">Mobile views</h3>
      <section class="default-paragraph with-images">
        <p class="default-paragraph">
        Although the design process did not follow a mobile first pattern, the application is capable of offering the same features for mobile devices which do not come equipped with large screens. The horizontal layout eased mobile front-end development, while preserving the functionality.

        The mobile dashboard, subscription control and expanded subscription:

        </section>

        <p class="default-paragraph">
        By building the application on a fluid grid system, all views could be adapted to smaller screen sizes. Further examples are the user overview or detailed consumption view:

      <p class="default-paragraph">
        The challenge behind this project was to create a responsive front-end application that gives overview and control over a company's users. It had to offer a detailed representation of call, SMS, MMS and data consumption and allow users to quickly switch between subscriptions and addon plans.
