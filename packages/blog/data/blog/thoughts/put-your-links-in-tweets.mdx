There is a big discussion if links in posts are a good idea or not.
I've looked through my analytics and have found that 4 of my posts that contain links have gotten 12k clicks in total. That's huge and it shows that posts with links in them **can** perform very well. But is that always the case?

I think in this case, it has helped a lot. Don't you?

Here's one example with link + image

Here's another example of a link + video

<EmbedTweet tweetId="1716016319714165116" />

People claim that having a link in the tweet can reduce the reach of the tweet, but I think this is more complicated.

Reach doesn't necessarily mean conversion, on less your tweet is a clickbait style e.g.:

> I wrote a free guide on how to make $1M in 1 month, link in comments

I'd argue that putting the link in the main tweet will give you a better chance of people visiting that link. After all, everyone has a limited time span and performing 2 actions instead of one will result in some sort of drop in conversion %.

I've made this experiment to at least see if the exact same tweet with/without the link will perform differently.

I will be tracking performance and updating this post with the results.

Here's the post without the link:

<EmbedTweet tweetId="1769975604047380561" />

Here's the post with the link:

<EmbedTweet tweetId="1770353592035422313" />

I'll check back in 48h and get the stats for both tweets.

This is part of an experiment on Twitter/𝕏 where I post the same 2 tweets with a link and without to see which one performs better.
