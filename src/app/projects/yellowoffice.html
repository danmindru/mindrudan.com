      <h3 class="normal-title second-title">Introduction</h3>
      <p class="default-paragraph">
      Metropolis &#38 Yellow Office are two architecture firms that solicited my collaboration in developing a system that allowed them to create and manage projects that are part of their portfolio.
      By collaborating with them I took on a challenge, especially when it came to back-end development.<br/>
      Making abstraction of the digital, interaction and experience design, the biggest milestones where marked by learning new development techniques in a short amount of time. Some of these were: security (hashing, encrypting, spam prevention, session tokens), creating a dynamic &#38 editable grid system, developing asynchronous multiple-file upload mechanisms or designing a light-weight responsive system for mobile devices.
      </p>

      <h3 class="normal-title second-title">The process</h3>
      <p class="default-paragraph">
        From the beginning, the clear direction of the project was established by the strategic goal of the firms, which was international expansion. The interaction concept had to be created from a few basic assumptions of functionality, without many specific requirements stated.<br/>
        The first step was planning and communicating the chosen direction. Being on the same page with the concept was essential, mainly because it required the clients to participate in concept development and give feedback along the way. Afterwards this step, the first back-end sketches were created. Following a <u>sketch</u> &#126 <u>wireframe</u> &#126 <u>mock-up</u> &#126 <u>prototype</u> &#126 <u>shipped functionality</u> 'system', all of the backend was delivered in a agile manner. Prior to the first back-end beta, the first database architecture (ER Diagram) was drafted.
        <br/>
        The next step included the development of the front-end, which was done in a similar manner. It was then shipped as a demo.
        <br/>
        Finally, after bug fixes a final product was ready for launch.

      <h3 class="normal-title second-title">The back-end</h3>
      <section class="default-paragraph with-images">
        <p class="default-paragraph">The back-end is a step-by-step management hub, a custom light-weight platform that allows fast adding or editing of content. The primary feature is quick-storage of a project in the system.</p>

        </section>
        <p class="default-paragraph">Adding a project is done in 4 steps:</p>

        <ul class="a-list">
          <li><strong>Inserting the project information</strong><br/>
            <p class="default-paragraph">The first stage requires the addition of basic information such as name, type and location.</p>
            <section class="zoom-image enlargableImage wow animated fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s" data-wow-duration="0.3s">
              <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/19638701/Yellowoffice-mindrudancom" target="_blank"><img alt="Yellow Office and Metropolis" src="src/assets/img/projects/metropolis/metropolis2.png" class="regular-image"/></a>
            </section>
            <p class="default-paragraph">The information is automatically reused for fields that do not usually require the user's attention.<br/> In some cases, they are even beyond the user's competences, therefore they are being filled before he reaches them.
            For example, the project url, Facebook Meta and Date are automatically generated based on information previously entered:</p>

            </section>
          </li><br/>
          <li><strong>Adding the project images, sorting and choosing the background</strong><br/>
            <p class="default-paragraph">The addition of images is limited to a minimum amount of steps. Only selecting a series of images starts the upload and in a matter of seconds they are displayed as thumbnails underneath.</p>
            <section class="zoom-image enlargableImage wow animated fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s" data-wow-duration="0.3s">

            </section>

            <p class="default-paragraph">Furthermore, images can be uploaded on multiple turns. The user is also allowed to manipulate them right after upload:</p>
            <section class="zoom-image enlargableImage wow animated fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s" data-wow-duration="0.3s">
              <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/19638701/Yellowoffice-mindrudancom" target="_blank"><img alt="Yellow Office and Metropolis" src="src/assets/img/projects/metropolis/metropolis-upload.png" class="regular-image"/></a>
            </section>
            Example of deletion:

            </section>

          </li><br/>
          <li><strong>Positioning the project thumbnail on the 'grid'</strong><br/>
            <p class="default-paragraph">The grid is in fact the homepage of the website. It is a responsive grid that reacts to screen rotation or resizing and can be maximized to full screen (details will be shown at the front-end chapter).</p>
            <section class="zoom-image enlargableImage wow animated fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s" data-wow-duration="0.3s">
              <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/19638701/Yellowoffice-mindrudancom" target="_blank"><img alt="Yellow Office and Metropolis" src="src/assets/img/projects/metropolis/metropolis-grid.png" class="regular-image"/></a>
            </section>
            The user is given a random grid position that can be manually changed. Further editing the grid can be done also after the project has been uploaded.
          </li><br/>

          <li><strong>Publishing the project, displaying as news and other checkboxes</strong><br/>
            <p class="default-paragraph">Finally, the last step consists of the actual submission of project data. A few options can be 'ticked' and are later editable from the project manager.</p>
            <section class="zoom-image enlargableImage wow animated fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s" data-wow-duration="0.3s">

            </section>
          </li><br/>
        </ul>

        <p class="default-paragraph">The steps above are built in a responsive manner, therefore allowing projects to be added via mobile device.</p>
        <section class="zoom-image enlargableImage wow animated fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s" data-wow-duration="0.3s">

        </section><br/>
        <p class="default-paragraph">The parent (from the database point of view - the projects have 'category_id' as a foreign key, 1 to many relation) container of the projects 'categories' is also manageable in the backend. The categories screen allows fast access of add or delete commands and offers an overview of the existing projects. Projects can be filtered by category and status.</p>
        <section class="zoom-image enlargableImage wow animated fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s" data-wow-duration="0.3s">

        </section>
        <p class="default-paragraph">A thing to note: throughout the back-end basic user errors are considered in order to create a better user experience. For example, in this case categories that contain projects cannot be deleted, preventing an action that will result in the deletion of multiple projects.
          All project info can be edited from the project manager page. Leaving the CRUD features aside, a "publish/unpublish" button is present for fast switching of the projects state.</p>
        <p class="default-paragraph">User errors are prevented for certain actions by requiring confirmations (for example, deletion).</p>

        </section>
        <p class="default-paragraph">Before leaving the back-end description, it is worth saying that it's architecture was built to be scalable and extendable. The platform had to be customized for both organizations, Metropolis and Yellow Office. Each of the organizations had different projects with small specific front-end requirements - a tailored system for their needs.</p>

          The front-end is built on a fluid grid system, using the entire screen canvas to display beautiful imagery.<br/>
          Pages take advantage of high resolution images, having a content-first approach.

          As with the back-end, views are adapted for lower resolutions.

        The challenge behind this project was to create an extendeble system that 'supports' the new expansion strategies followed by the two client organizations. A close collaboration with the firms resulted in the development of a small in-house CMS, with a responsive back-end and front-end design that is easy to update.
