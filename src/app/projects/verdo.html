      <h3 class="normal-title second-title">Introduction</h3>
      <p class="default-paragraph">
      This project covers the concept development and prototyping of Verdo's web ecosystem redesign. Among hundreds of pages and a mess of contact information, Verdo was built on an information architecture that couldn't handle the scale of its content any longer. The redesign initiative is focused on expanding the entire ecosystem to mobile devices, which were not even considered to this point.

      <h3 class="normal-title second-title">The process</h3>
      <section class="default-paragraph with-images">
        <p class="default-paragraph">
        The project started with a discussion and analysis of Verdo's corporate identity. It was followed by the consolidation of its main brand elements. Afterwards, the current information architecture was dissected and a new one was proposed. Through iteration, a final information structure was decided upon. Lastly, following a mobile first approach the wireframes, mock-ups and prototype was developed.

      <h3 class="normal-title second-title">Information architecture</h3>
      <section class="default-paragraph with-images">
        <p class="default-paragraph"><strong>Old architecture</strong><br/>
          The foundation of the concept is based on the analysis of current information architecture. A meticulous analysis revealed the following structure:
        </p>
        <section class="zoom-image enlargableImage wow animated fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.8s" data-wow-duration="0.3s">
          <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/19638873/Verdo-mindrudancom" target="_blank"><img alt="Verdo" src="src/assets/img/projects/verdo/ai.png" class="regular-image"/></a>
        </section>
        <p class="default-paragraph">
        At first sight, Verdo's information architecture shows a high degree of complexity. The diagram suggests that also a lot of content has to be present on the various sections illustrated.
        After familiarizing with the present sections, it is visible that often pages are used just to link to other content (pages that refer to internal pages, which could not exist independently). Moreover, pages with only a few lines of text are a common sight, as well as repeated contact information and descriptions.
        </p>
        <p class="default-paragraph"><strong>New architecture</strong><br/>
        A deeper analysis supports the idea that many of the constraints in the information architecture arise due to the technical limits, particular development practices used in this ASP.NET application. The newly proposed information architecture suggests a new structure that simplifies the sections and heavily reduces the amount of pages:

        <section class="zoom-image enlargableImage wow animated fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.8s" data-wow-duration="0.3s">

        </section>
        <p class="default-paragraph">
        The new architecture offers a more logical and efficient organization of the content and now can be used as base for the redesign. The vision implied is: "Follow a mobile first design driven development pattern. Anticipate usage context to display the correct information that is accessible and consistent across platforms."

      <h3 class="normal-title second-title">Mobile first design</h3>
      <section class="default-paragraph with-images">
        <p class="default-paragraph">
        The mock-ups for devices with less screen space where built to efficiently use the provided space. They hold the essential functionality and use an off canvas navigation pattern. The layout will be progressively enhanced as screens get larger.
        </p>
        <section class="zoom-image enlargableImage wow animated fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.8s" data-wow-duration="0.3s">

        </section>
        <p class="default-paragraph">
          The design anticipates common use cases for devices with such screen sizes. For instance, emergency and panic situations are covered firstly in the upper part of the layout.
          Afterwards, services are listed as a horizontally and clearly separated for overview. Imagery is reduced in favor of simpler graphical elements. This is beneficial in two ways: aids slow internet connections and saves on precious space in the already narrow canvas.<br/>
          Company tools (about, cases, sponsorships etc.) are hidden in the left off canvas navigation, while the login to private areas is represented by an icon on the top right.
        </p>
        <p class="default-paragraph">
          Increasing the canvas size (possibly tablet sizes), the view continues to follow the same principles, but organizes the information in a way that takes advantage of the wider canvas.<br/>
          Both the tablet and the smart phone versions are not emphasizing on selling products, but rather on offering a good user experience and helping the user get what he came for.

      <!-- <h3 class="normal-title second-title">Large screen sizes</h3> -->
      <section class="default-paragraph with-images">
        <p class="default-paragraph">
        A big contrast is obvious when moving to larger screen sizes, where the 'light-weight' layout turns into an attractive commercial display of services. It attempts to reflect the company values, mission and vision into a full screen display of the amazing range products and services Verdo has to offer.
        The larger version also has additions when it comes to navigation and utility, with extended service descriptions.

        <p class="default-paragraph">
          As with the smaller screen sizes, the most common scenarios are anticipated. The focus moves on promotion of services and advertising, including high quality imagery and larger accompanying graphical elements.

        </section>
        <p class="default-paragraph">
          Navigating through services should be done via mouse scroll (swipe up/down), with subtle transitions between services that overlay a new page over the current one. Seamless transitions are essential in maintaining the pleasant user experience. With this approach, each service becomes it's own 'sub-brand', with it's own story and characteristic design (one service, one story).
        </p>
        <p class="default-paragraph">
        One advantage of mobile first design is that the layouts for larger screens inherit mobile properties. The off canvas navigation persists and remains hidden without obscuring content. Decisions taken for smaller screens result in a efficient layout also for the larger ones:

        The challenge behind this project was to adapt the information architecture to function as a foundation for the redesign.Based on it, a responsive concept was develop that adapted to the different screen sizes and use cases.
