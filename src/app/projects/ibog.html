      <h3 class="normal-title second-title">Introduction</h3>
      <p class="default-paragraph">
        This project covered the concept development and prototyping of an interactive reading web application. The product was targeted at children 7-12 years old.
      </p>

      <h3 class="normal-title second-title">Process &#38 concept overview </h3>
      <section class="default-paragraph with-images">
        <p class="default-paragraph">
          The development started with a thorough target group analysis, followed by a style and color analysis. The outlines of the proposed concept are the following:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Simplify</strong><br/>
              <p class="default-paragraph">
                Reduce the amount of functionality and graphics to the minimum, focus on the content.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Strive for composition balance</strong><br/>
              <p class="default-paragraph">
                Discover the right combination between an easy to read and pleasantly scalable font. Place the content for readability, reduce UI complexity in favor of content clarity.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Embrace color</strong><br/>
              <p class="default-paragraph">
                Use color to build appealing scenes for the target group. Colors should be used to suggest the context and engage users into a interactive-discovery process.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Use reading as experience / Time as navigation</strong><br/>
              <p class="default-paragraph">
                Offer more than a tool for learning, offer a learning experience. Transitions, subtle movements, automatic context-aware and user type options are tools to build such an experience. The users should feel in control and be able to input changes.<br/>
                Use time to motivate and give a sense of control or task complexity.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Assist users with common challenges</strong><br/>
              <p class="default-paragraph">
                Basic tools will be there for the typical challenges met by the target audience. This will allow learning without external distractions. Rather than having to often stop and search for information, all the needed content will be present within the application.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Engage / Learn without pressure</strong><br/>
              <p class="default-paragraph">
                Allow users to skip tasks and choose what and when they want to do it.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Offer methods of expression</strong><br/>
              <p class="default-paragraph">
                Harvest the target group's creativity by allowing the manipulation of layouts, scenes and characters present in the text.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </section>

      <h3 class="normal-title second-title">Simplify - the foundation of the concept</h3>
      <section class="default-paragraph with-images">
        <p class="default-paragraph">
          At its heart, the concept should offer a clean and straightforward reading experience. Reading is the most important element of the application. Therefore, this is where the concept starts to develop.

          The target group is persuaded to continue and stay focused on the content.
          Once the book is loaded, the system scans for keywords and creates a scene matching the book content.
          In this case, the keyword ‘cold’ was ‘captured’ and used. The scene changes as follows.

          Color is one of the most important elements in the concept. While it offers surprise and excitement, it can also help with giving focus. Color schemes and combinations are carefully picked for the target audience.

          Color combinations may occur on different keyword triggers. The key is, offer a balance of colors to extend and vary the experience (without making it predictable). The emotions generated play a key role in memorizing and understanding the content.

        <p class="default-paragraph">
          The expressivity of the web has to be taken advantage of in order to make reading a memorable experience. Context movement and dynamic color changes can play a key role. For example, changing a page will be more than a simple text load or scroll, but a complete change of scene:

        As before, a keyword is selected to generate the scene. The title, author and time remain as in the first page. The scenes are dynamic and change after longer periods of reading. This should again help regain focus and motivate users. In the next example, the keyword changes to ‘burning’. This will change the scene as follows:

        Finally, use time to coordinate and measure progress, not the number of pages, not the number of chapters. Pages will vary depending on screen sizes, therefore they will not be a useful measurement tool. Time passing will be animated and users will feel that they are advancing, they are getting close to completion. Reading can be paused on desktop computers or laptops by pressing ‘space’ or ‘p’. On touch-enabled devices, reading can be paused by touching the corresponding icon, as follows.

          Understanding that the target group may have a limited vocabulary, it is easy to see that distraction when searching for unknown words will be a major obstacle. The solution is the following: users can (and are encourage to) explore each word and get an explanation in the context.
        </p>
        <p class="default-paragraph">
        The explanation transitions from the bottom of the screen, accompanied by a graphical element to stimulate visual memory.

        This functionality can be considered as being core of the concept by 3 measures.<br/>
        <strong>Firstly</strong>, it will encourage users to click and discover definitions of many words in the text.<br/>
        <strong>Secondly</strong>, it will help users establish visual relations between a definition and a graphical element.<br/>
        <strong>Lastly</strong>, it will allow the users to exercise their creativity and build their own 'world' around the current literature.<br/>
        This technique can be extended by allowing users to build characters in a fairytale or even offering creative mini-games.
